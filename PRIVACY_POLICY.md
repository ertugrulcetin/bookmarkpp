# Privacy Policy for Bookmark++

**Effective Date:** 11/06/2025
**Last Updated:** 11/06/2025

## Overview

Bookmark++ is a local-first bookmark manager Chrome extension that prioritizes your privacy and data ownership. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our extension.

## Our Privacy Philosophy

**Local-First, Cloud-Optional**: Your data belongs to you. By default, all your bookmarks and data are stored locally on your device. Cloud synchronization is entirely optional and uses your own private GitHub account.

## What Information We Collect

### Website Content (Only When You Bookmark)
When you save a bookmark, we collect:
- **Website URL** - The web page address you're bookmarking
- **Page Title** - The title of the webpage
- **Page Description** - Meta description from the webpage (if available)
- **Favicon** - The website's icon image
- **Open Graph Images** - Preview images from the webpage (if available)
- **Your Notes** - Any text you add as notes to your bookmarks
- **Selected Text** - When you use "Add to Bookmark++" context menu on selected text

### Extension Preferences
- Your dashboard view preferences (list/card/detail view)
- Search and filter settings
- Keyboard shortcuts you configure
- Sync preferences (auto-sync enabled/disabled)

### Optional GitHub Integration Data
If you choose to enable GitHub sync:
- **GitHub Access Token** - Stored securely to access your GitHub Gists
- **GitHub Gist ID** - To identify your private bookmark storage gist
- **GitHub Username** - For display purposes in the extension

## What Information We Do NOT Collect

We explicitly **do not** collect:
- Your browsing history (only pages you explicitly bookmark)
- Personal identification information (name, email, address, phone)
- Health or medical information
- Financial or payment information
- Location data or IP addresses
- User activity monitoring (clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes)
- Personal communications (emails, messages, chats)
- Any data from websites you visit but don't bookmark

## How We Store and Use Your Information

### Local Storage (Default)
- All bookmark data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API
- Data never leaves your device unless you enable GitHub sync
- No data is transmitted to our servers or third parties

### Optional GitHub Sync
- If enabled, your bookmark data is stored in **your own private GitHub Gist**
- We use GitHub's API only to read/write your bookmark data to your account
- Your GitHub token is stored securely on your device
- You maintain full control over your GitHub data

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We **do not**:
- Sell, rent, or trade your personal information
- Share your data with advertisers or marketing companies  
- Use your data for purposes unrelated to bookmark management
- Transfer your data to third parties except as described below

**Limited Third-Party Access:**
- **GitHub**: Only if you enable sync, and only to your own private Gists
- **Chrome Storage API**: For local data storage (managed by Google Chrome)

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your data:

### Access and Export
- Export all bookmarks as JSON at any time
- Import bookmarks from Pocket CSV files
- View all stored data through the extension dashboard

### Modification and Deletion
- Edit or delete individual bookmarks anytime
- Clear all bookmarks with one click
- Disable or remove GitHub sync connection
- Uninstall the extension to remove all local data

### Sync Controls

## Data Security

### Local Data Protection

- No data transmitted without your explicit action

### GitHub Sync Security
- Uses GitHub's secure OAuth token system
- All communications with GitHub use HTTPS encryption
- Private Gists are only accessible to your GitHub account
- Tokens are stored securely and can be revoked anytime

## Data Retention

### Local Data
- Remains on your device until you delete bookmarks or uninstall the extension
- No automatic expiration or deletion

### GitHub Sync Data
- Stored in your GitHub account according to GitHub's retention policies
- You control retention through your GitHub account settings
- Disconnecting sync does not delete your GitHub Gist (you control this)
